ABSTRAKT:
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) measures the gene expression level for each gene in each cell in a sample. A sample 
typically consists of a few thousand cells, and the observed gene expression level in 10-30,000 genes. The gene expression 
level is a non-negative integer with values ranging from 0 to several thousands, but the majority - often as much as 
$90 \%$ - of observed expression levels is 0. The positive expression levels are highly skewed towards lower levels. A 
substantial proportion of the 0 observations is due to shortcomings in the scRNA-seq technology: failure of capturing 
positive gene expression levels, referred to as {\it dropouts}. 

The cells in a sample come from different types and subtypes, but the cell type labels are not available, except for
laboratory grown samples. The main objective of cell clustering is to group together those cells that show similar gene 
expression patterns, so that cell types can be correctly identified, and possibly new subtypes can be revealed. The 
dropout rate varies from cell to cell, even within the same cell type, and cells that have similar biological gene 
expression pattern will not have similar observed gene expression pattern.

We propose a clustering method for sparse, high-dimensional scRNA-seq data that contains the following parts:
(0) Binarization of the gene expression level into not expressed (0) and expressed (1). 
(1a) A non-symmetric dissimilarity measure based on cell-to-cell conditional probability: $P(X_{ij}=1|x_{\ellj}= 1)$,
where $x_{ij}$ is the gene expression of gene $j$ in cell $i$. 
(1b) A corresponding clustering that serves as starting point for an iterative EM-like algorithm.
(2a) Estimation of a prototype cell for each cluster: a cell without dropouts. 
(2b) Estimation of the dropout rate for each cell.
(2c) Clustering based on the maximum log likelihood. 
Step (2a)-(2c) is repeated until convergence.

We show that this method gives correct cell clustering for laboratory grown samples, and we demonstrate the results on 
samples from patients.
